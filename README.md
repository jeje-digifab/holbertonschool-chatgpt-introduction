# Project: Integrating AI into Everyday Coding Practices

## Introduction

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum focused on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday coding practices. This project emphasizes two key aspects of software development: debugging and automation. Through this project, you'll learn to leverage ChatGPT to efficiently identify and resolve errors, as well as automate repetitive coding tasks to enhance your productivity and improve code quality.

## Objectives

### Debugging
- **Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors.** You'll use ChatGPT to diagnose and fix bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in diverse coding environments.

### Automation
- **Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with ChatGPT.** This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, allowing you to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.

## Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills:** Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with the ability to clearly articulate problems and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.

- **Automation Proficiency:** Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, resulting in more structured and error-free code.

## Hands-On Activities

You will engage in hands-on activities reflecting real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of traditional coding methods through AI integration. This approach not only prepares you for future technological advancements but also equips you with skills that are increasingly in demand in the tech industry.

## Instructions

1. **Debugging:**
   - Use the provided code samples to identify errors.
   - Apply ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs.
   - Test and verify the corrections made.

2. **Automation:**
   - Utilize ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code and documentation.
   - Create automated unit tests for your projects.
   - Verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the automations created.

## Notes

Remember to test, verify, and critically evaluate the information provided by ChatGPT. Do not hesitate to question or double-check the responses to ensure their accuracy and relevance to your needs.
